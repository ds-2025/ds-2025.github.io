## Aims & Scope

Discovery Science 2025 conference provides an open forum for intensive discussions and exchange of new ideas among researchers working in the area of Discovery Science. The conference focus is on the use of Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Big Data Analytics methods in science. Its scope includes the development and analysis of methods for discovering scientific knowledge, coming from machine learning, data mining, intelligent data analysis, and big data analytics, as well as their application in various domains.

The Posters Track complements the research track of the conference and offers an opportunity to present late-breaking results and showcase innovative implementations in an informal and interactive setting. During the Poster session authors are encouraged to directly connect with conference participants and engage in discussions about their work.

We invite submissions relevant to Discovery Science and which address, but are not limited to, the topics of the Research Track. We also welcome work that has already been seen in other places but needs to be shared with the Discovery Science community.
