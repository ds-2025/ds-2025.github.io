## Please meet AI, our dear new colleague. In other words: can scientists and machines truly cooperate?
How can AI and LLMs facilitate the work of scientists in different stages of the research process? Can technology even make scientists obsolete? The role of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) in science as the target application domain has recently been rapidly growing. This includes assessing the impact of scientific work, facilitating writing and revising manuscripts as well as intelligent support for manuscript quality assessment, peer-review and scientific discussions. The talk will illustrate such methods and models using several tasks from the scientific domain. We argue that while AI and LLMs can effectively support and augment specific steps of the research process, expert-AI collaboration may be a more promising mode for complex research tasks.

## Biography
Iryna Gurevych is Professor of Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing in the Department of Computer Science at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany. She also is an adjunct professor at MBZUAI in Abu-Dhabi, UAE, and an affiliated professor at INSAIT in Sofia, Bulgaria. She is widely known for fundamental contributions to natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Professor Gurevych is a past president of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), the leading professional society in NLP. Her many accolades include being a Fellow of the ACL, an ELLIS Fellow, and the recipient of an ERC Advanced Grant. Most recently, she has received the 2025 Milner award of the British Royal Society for her major contributions to NLP and artificial intelligence that combine deep understanding of human language and cognitive faculty with the latest paradigms in machine learning.
