## Aims & Scope

We invite submissions to the 28<sup>th</sup> International Conference on Discovery Science, welcoming paper submissions from all areas relevant to artificial intelligence and data science.

The Discovery Science 2025 conference provides an open forum for intensive discussions and exchange of new ideas among researchers working in different areas of Artificial Intelligence and the data sciences, focusing on discovering and advancing scientific knowledge. Its scope includes the development and analysis of methods for discovering scientific knowledge, coming from machine learning, data mining, intelligent data analysis, and big data analytics, as well as their application in various domains of physical, life, environmental, natural and social sciences.

This year’s edition of Discovery Science welcomes works that focuses on the following topics, that will be the subject of special sessions within the conference:

- Explainable AI 4 Science
- Symbolic regression 4 Science
- Semantic technologies 4 Science
- Foundation models 4 Science
- Physics informed NNs 4 Science

In addition to the main sessions, the conference will also include parallel one-day events, dedicated to the following topics:

- AI & Environmental sciences
- AI & HPC
- AI & Biomedicine
- AI & Materials sciences
- AI & Physics
- AI & Space
- Challenges in Applied AI

The conference’s relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

- Machine Learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning
- Active learning, online learning, transfer learning, continual learning etc.
- Reinforcement learning
- AutoML, Meta-Learning, Planning to Learn
- Representation learning for vision, text, audio, language, and other data modalities
- Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
- Anomaly and Outlier Detection
- Learning from Complex Data
  - Data Streams, Evolving Data, Change Detection & Concept drift
  - Time-Series Analysis
  - Spatial, Temporal and Spatiotemporal Data Analysis
  - Unstructured Data Analysis (textual and web data)
  - Learning on graphs and other topologies
  - Complex Network Analysis
- Causal Modelling and reasoning
- Neurosymbolic & hybrid AI systems (physics-informed, logic & formal reasoning, etc.)
- Data and Knowledge Visualization
- Explainable AI and Interpretable Machine Learning
- Human-Machine Interaction for Knowledge Discovery and Management
- AI and High-performance Computing, Grid and Cloud Computing
- Optimisation
- AI and Cybersecurity
- AI Creativity
- Process Discovery and Analysis
- Evaluation of Models and Predictions in Discovery Setting
- Applications of the above techniques in scientific domains, such as Physical sciences (e.g., materials sciences, particle physics), Life sciences (e.g., biology, medicine, neuroscience etc.), Environmental sciences, Natural and social sciences

## Submission Procedure

Contributions, written in English, must be formatted according to the guidelines of the Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer-Verlag, which are available together with templates [here](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

Submission System: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DS2025/](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DS2025/).

The Microsoft CMT service was used for managing the peer-reviewing process for this conference. This service was provided for free by Microsoft and they bore all expenses, including costs for Azure cloud services as well as for software development and support.

## Main conference

We invite original contributions that have not been previously published to another venue. The page limit for the contributions submitted to the main conference, including special sessions, is 15 pages in the LNCS format (note that 15 pages in LNCS format is roughly equivalent to 8 pages in NeurIPS format). This includes figures, title pages, references, and appendices.

Submission of the camera-ready version of the paper has to include the authors’ consent to publish on the above Springer LNCS website. Submissions will be reviewed following a single-blind procedure. Therefore, authors should include their names and affiliations in the paper. Authors may not submit any paper which is under review elsewhere or which has been accepted for publication in a journal or another conference; neither will they submit their papers elsewhere during the review period of DS 2025.

Accepted papers will be published in the [Discovery Science Springer LNCS series](https://link.springer.com/conference/dis).

## One-day event (Workshops)

We invite original technical/position papers or contributions discussing published works. We particularly welcome contributions presenting initial or late-breaking results as well as ongoing work, including works currently under review at other venues.

For the parallel one-day events, the page limit for contributions is 2 pages in LNCS format, including figures, title pages, references, and appendices. Submissions to the parallel one-day events are non-archival, and therefore will not be included in the conference proceedings.
