We invite submissions to the **28th International Conference on Discovery Science**, welcoming paper submissions from all areas relevant to artificial intelligence and data science.

The **Discovery Science 2025** conference provides an open forum for intensive discussions and exchange of new ideas among researchers working in different areas of Artificial Intelligence and the data sciences, focusing on discovering and advancing scientific knowledge. Its scope includes developing and analyzing methods for discovering scientific knowledge, coming from machine learning, data mining, intelligent data analysis, and big data analytics, as well as their application in various domains of physical, life, environmental, natural and social sciences.

## Aims & Scope

The conference’s relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

- Machine Learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning
- Active learning, online learning, transfer learning, continual learning etc.
- Reinforcement learning
- AutoML, Meta-Learning, Planning to Learn
- Representation learning for vision, text, audio, language, and other data modalities
- Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
- Anomaly and Outlier Detection
- Learning from Complex Data
  - Data Streams, Evolving Data, Change Detection & Concept drift
  - Time-Series Analysis
  - Spatial, Temporal and Spatio-temporal Data Analysis
  - Unstructured Data Analysis (textual and web data)
  - Learning on graphs and other topologies
  - Complex Network Analysis
- Causal Modeling and reasoning
- Neuro-symbolic learning & hybrid AI systems (logic & formal reasoning, etc.)
- Physics-informed machine learning
- Computational equation discovery and Symbolic Regression
- Data and Knowledge Visualization
- Explainable AI and Interpretable Machine Learning
- Human-Machine Interaction for Knowledge Discovery and Management
- AI and High-performance Computing, Grid and Cloud Computing
- Optimisation
- AI Creativity
- Process Discovery and Analysis
- Evaluation of Models and Predictions in Discovery Setting
- Applications of the above techniques in scientific domains, such as Physical sciences (e.g., materials sciences, particle physics), Life sciences (e.g., biology, medicine, neuroscience etc.), Environmental sciences, Natural and social sciences

This year’s edition of Discovery Science particularly welcomes works that focus on the following themes, that will be the subject of special sessions within the conference:

- Explainable AI for Science
- Symbolic Regression for Science
- Semantic Technologies for Science
- Foundation Models for Science
- Physics-informed Methods for Science

In addition to the main track, the conference will also host parallel one-day events, with topics focusing on specific applications of AI to different scientific disciplines. Please check [ai4science.ijs.si](https://ai4science.ijs.si/) for more details.

## Submission Procedure

Contributions, written in English, must be formatted according to the guidelines of the Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer-Verlag, which are available together with [templates here](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

DS 2025 will use The Microsoft CMT service to manage the peer-reviewing process for this conference.

Please submit your contributions at [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DS2025/](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DS2025/).

### **Main conference**

We invite original contributions that have not been previously published to another venue. The page limit for the contributions submitted to the main conference, including special sessions, is 15 pages in the LNCS format (note that 15 pages in LNCS format is roughly equivalent to 8 pages in NeurIPS format). This includes figures, title pages, references, and appendices.

Submission of the camera-ready version of the paper has to include the authors’ consent to publish on the above Springer LNCS website. Submissions will be reviewed following a single-blind procedure. Therefore, authors should include their names and affiliations in the paper. Authors may not submit any paper that is under review elsewhere or has been accepted for publication in a journal or another conference; neither will they submit their papers elsewhere during the review period of DS 2025.

Accepted papers will be published in the [Discovery Science Springer LNCS series](https://link.springer.com/conference/dis).

### **One-day event (Workshops)**

DS2025 will include several satellite events dedicated to specific applications of AI to science and technology. We invite original technical/position papers or contributions discussing published works. We particularly welcome contributions presenting initial or late-breaking results as well as ongoing work, including works currently under review at other venues.

For the parallel one-day events, the page limit for contributions is 2 pages in LNCS format, including figures, title pages, references, and appendices. Submissions to the parallel one-day events are non-archival and, therefore, will not be included in the conference proceedings.

Please check [ai4science.si](https://ai4science.si/) for more details.

### **Call for Late Breaking Contributions**

DS2025 provides an open forum for intensive discussions and exchange of new ideas among researchers working in the area of Discovery Science. The conference focus is on the use of Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Big Data Analytics methods in science. Its scope includes the development and analysis of methods for discovering scientific knowledge, coming from machine learning, data mining, intelligent data analysis, and big data analytics, as well as their application in various domains.

Please check [Call for Late Breaking Contributions](/CfPosters/) for more details.
