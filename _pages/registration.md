There are three registration stages available for participants:

- Early-bird registration deadline: 8 August, 2025
- Regular registration deadline: 5 September, 2025 (or until the tickets run out (whichever comes first))
- Late registration deadline: 19 September, 2025 (or until the tickets run out (whichever comes first))

We advise opting for early registration as it offers a reduced registration fee.

Kindly be advised that our registration fee is a fixed flat rate, regardless of the duration of attendance. Even if you plan to participate for fewer than five days, you will still be charged the same fee.

Registration fee grants you access to all conference tracks and covers lunches, coffee-breaks, 2 social events, and free public bus transport in Ljubljana city. Please note that accommodation expenses are not covered in the registration fee.
